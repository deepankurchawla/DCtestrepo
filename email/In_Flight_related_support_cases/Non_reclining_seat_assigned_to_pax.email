We regret the inconvenience caused. For future reference, you may allocate a seat prior to travelling by opting for a web check in (provided the conditions associated with the same are fulfilled). Log on to http://www.spicejet.com/web-checkin-india.asp for the full terms & conditions.

You may also request the airport staff at the time of check in to reserve a seat of your preference. If available they shall definitely comply.
