Dear Mr./Ms. , 
  
PNR No. : 

Greetings from SpiceJet.

The bicycle must be placed - with handlebars fixed sideways and pedals removed - in a rigid and/or hard shell container specifically designed for shipping or in a bicycle suitcase (in the case of collapsible bicycles).

For bikes that are not packed in a hardshell bike suitcase, the handles must be turned around, pedals must be taken off, other additional parts must be removed or covered and the tyres must be deflated.

A handling fee of 750 INR would be applicable on the same.

Carriage of bicycles would be subject to airport discretion.

Should you require further assistance, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.

Assuring you of our best attention at all times.


Thanks & Regards,


Customer Relations,
SpiceJet Limited.
