Dear Mr./Ms. , 
  
PNR No. : 

Greetings from SpiceJet.

For changes/cancellation of bookings SpiceJet charges a standard nominal fee of 1000 INR/1850 INR/3000NPR/4500LKR/135 AED/35 USD per change/cancellation per Passenger per one way. 

SpiceJet follows a dynamic pricing structure and accordingly the fare per flight varies as per the number of available seats. Accordingly for changes to the date/flight/origin/destination, SpiceJet charges the difference in fare in addition to the applicable fee. 

Instead of charging a percentage of the fare towards these changes SpiceJet charges a standard fare irrespective of the fare the original booking was made on that too up to 2 hours prior/4 hours prior to the departure of the booked flight. 

       We would like to thank you for conveying your feedback about the applicable charges. 

Should you require further assistance, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.

Assuring you of our best attention at all times.

Thanks & Regards,


Customer Relations,
