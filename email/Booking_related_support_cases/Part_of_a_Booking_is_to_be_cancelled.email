Dear Mr./Ms. , 
  
PNR No. : 

Greetings from SpiceJet.

To cancel the booking for one passenger out of a group please call 9871803333/18001803333. Our executive shall assist you with the cancellation by splitting the PNR & retaining the confirmed passengers against the same PNR.

A fee of 1000 INR per Passenger per one way would be deducted towards the cancellation. The balance amount would be kept as credit for future bookings against a new PNR or you may opt for a refund.

The credit amount may be used for future bookings by calling 9871803333/18001803333 provided the name of the Passenger (s) on the original booking match with those on the fresh booking.

Should you require further assistance, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact us.

Assuring you of our best attention at all times.
