Greetings from SpiceJet.

Please note that name change on a confirmed booking is not permitted.  Whether the name has been spelt wrongly or a wrong name has been entered altogether we advise Passengers to cancel the existing booking (with the wrongly spelt/wrong name). A charge of 1500 INR per Passenger per one way would deducted toward the cancellation and you may book a fresh ticket in the correct name.

The current available fare would be applicable for the new booking and the difference is to be paid when confirming the booking.
