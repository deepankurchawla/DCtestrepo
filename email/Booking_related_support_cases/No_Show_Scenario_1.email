We would like to inform you that an  amount of 577 INR towards the Passenger Service Fee, Government Service Tax and Airport Fee paid on the ticket will be refundable. We would not be in a position to refund the rest of the fare. 

We would like to inform you that once the check-in is over, the other ground formalities need to be completed and then the details need to be compiled and handed over to the authorities for the flight to depart on time. We try our best to accommodate as many Passenger as we can but a Passenger is denied boarding only when it is beyond the control of the airline to accept Passenger once the counter is closed.

Assuring you of our best attention at all times.
